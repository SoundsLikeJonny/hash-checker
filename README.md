# Hash Checker
A simple tool for checking sha256 hashes when downloading files off the internet

More and more companies are providing sha256 hashes alongside their download links to give users peace of mind that their files are safe to run. 
Sites like [this](https://techdocs.akamai.com/download-ctr/docs/verify-checksum) provide directions for hashing files in the command prompt.

Hash Checker provides a very simple UI for checking sha256 hashes.

# Usage
- Select a file in your Downloads folder using Hash Checker. I'll use PowerToys for this example
